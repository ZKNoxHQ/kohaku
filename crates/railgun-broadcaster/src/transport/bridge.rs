//! Transport whose Waku node runs somewhere else, typically js-waku in the wallet's browser tab.
//!
//! The remote node calls [`BrowserBridge::exchange`] about once a second: it hands over what it
//! received and takes what has to be published. There is no mature Waku light client in Rust,
//! while js-waku is what every Railgun web wallet uses against the fleet's wss peers.
//!
//! The link is only alive while the remote node keeps calling. When it stops (tab closed), the
//! transport reports itself unreachable instead of queueing forever: a transact request is only
//! worth sending within the validity of its fee quote.
